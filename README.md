# deep-learning-challenge

### Overview
The purpose of this project was to design a neural network model to analyse and assess whether or not applicants applying to the Alphabet Soup Foundation are successful or not.

### Results
#### First Attempt
* Accuracy: 72.68%
* Loss: 0.6141403317451477
* 1st Layer: 100 Neurons, Relu
* 2nd Layer: 50 Neurons, Relu
* 20 Epoches

#### Optemised Attempt
The results from my optemised attempt are as follows:
* Accuracy: 78.83%
* Loss: 0.45980367064476013
* 1st Layer: 100 Neurons, Relu
* 2nd Layer: 50 Neurons, Sigmoid
* 3rd Layer: 10 Neurons, Sigmoid
* 50 Epoches

### Summary
So in conclusion a pretty significant jump can be seen from my two models. Firstly there is a sizeable jump in the accuracy after optemising going from 72.68% to 78.83%. There also is a a imporvment in the loss going from 0.614(to 3 d.p.) to 0.460(to 3 d.p.). Both of these show that the changes we have made have definetly improved the model.
